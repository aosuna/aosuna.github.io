          <h4>Duchess Potatoes</h4>
          <p>
		  <ul class="recipesTxt">
		  <li>Ingredients: 5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and diced, boiled until fork-tender.
				8 egg yolks; 1 stick of butter, softened; Salt and freshly ground black pepper; 
				nutmeg, 1 1/4 cup of heavy cream; 1 whole egg.</li><br>
		  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicon baking mat.</li>
		  <li>Lay the boiled potatoes on a baking sheet and place into the oven until slightly dried on the surface, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
		  <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven and process through a ricer or food mill. Allow to cool in a bowl for about 5 minutes. </li>
		  <li>Add the egg yolks, butter, a couple generous pinches of salt, a generous pinch of pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and 3/4 cup cream. 
			  Stir with a rubber spatula to combine. Taste and make sure the potatoes have been adequately salted. </li>
		  <li>Transfer to a large pastry bag and pipe through a large star tip in a circular/upward spiral motion onto the prepared baking sheet. </li>
		  <li>Make an egg wash by mixing the whole egg with the remaining 1/2 cup cream. Lightly brush the piped potatoes with the egg wash. 
			 (This is a little easier if you chill the piped potatoes for half an hour or so.)</li>
		  <li>Make until golden brown around the edges.</li><br>
		  </ul>
		  </p>

		  <ul class="recipesTxt">
		  <li>Ingredients: 1 head garlic, olive oil, 2 pounds red potatoes, washed and quartered; Salt and freshly ground black pepper;
		  5 tablespoons butter, 3/4 cup heavy cream.</li><br>
		  <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
		  <li>Slice off the very top of the garlic head. Drizzle head with olive oil and wrap in foil. Place on a sheet tray and bake until tender and fragrant, roughly 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Remove the cloves and mash with a wooden spoon.</li>
		  <li>Place potatoes in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Add salt and bring to a boil. Cook until fork tender and drain. Mash the potatoes until smooth.</li>

          <h4>Potato Casserole</h4>
          <p>
		  <ul class="recipesTxt">
		  <li>Ingredients: Nonstick cooking spray (used for greasing baking dish); 6 large russet potatoes;
			  Pinch salt, 8 ounces sliced bacon, 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup
			  (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, Pinch garlic salt, Pinch freshly ground black pepper, 2 cups grated Cheddar</li><br>
			  
		  <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
		  <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Place the potatoes and salt in a pressure cooker with water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes until very tender, about 5 minutes. (If you do not have a pressure cooker, boil the potatoes in a pot of water with a pinch of salt until tender, about 20 minutes.)</li>
		  <li>While the potatoes boil, cook the bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels and, when cool enough to handle, crumble it into small pieces. Set aside.</li>
		  <li>Add the milk, mayonnaise, sour cream, butter, garlic salt, pepper and 1 cup of the cheese to a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Whip the mixture until thoroughly combined. Drain the potatoes and add to the mixer. Mix again to combine and the potatoes are whipped smooth.</li>
		  <li>Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the crumbled bacon and remaining 1 cup cheese over the top and bake until the cheese is melted and the casserole is heated through, about 20 minutes.</li>
		  </ul>

          <h4>Potato Soup</h4>
          
          <p>
		  <ul class="recipesTxt">
		  <li>Ingredients: 6 slices thin bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces, 3 carrots, scrubbed clean and diced, 
			  3 stalks celery, diced, 1 medium onion, diced, 6 small russet potatoes, peeled and diced, 
			  1/2 teaspoon Cajun spice mix, plus more if needed, Salt and freshly ground black pepper,
			  8 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, 1 cup milk, 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 
			  1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley, 1 cup grated Cheddar</li><br>
			  
		  <li>Add the bacon pieces to a soup pot over medium heat and cook until crisp and the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon from the pot and set it aside. Pour off most of the grease, but do not clean the pot.</li>
		  <li>Return the pot to medium-high heat and add the carrots, celery and onions. Stir and cook for 2 minutes or so, then add the diced potatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, seasoning with the Cajun spice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Pour in the broth and bring it to a gentle boil. Cook until the potatoes are starting to get tender, about 10 minutes. Whisk together the milk and flour, then pour the mixture into the soup and allow the soup to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
		  <li>Remove about half of the soup and blend in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Pour it back into the soup pot and stir to combine. Let it heat back up as you taste for seasoning, adding more of what it needs. Stir in the cream, then the parsley</li>
		  <li>Serve in bowls garnished with the grated cheese and crisp bacon pieces.</li>
		  
		  </ul>
